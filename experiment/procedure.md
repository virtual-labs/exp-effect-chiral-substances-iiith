The experiment is devided inte two parts:

   - Study of dispersive effect
   - Study of absorptive effect 


    **Study of dispersive effect:**
   1. In the first step you can observe "Change in Optical Rotation Due to Change in Difference of RI(Refractive Index)". Here n1 means RI of LCPL and n2 means RI of RCPL.
   2. 5 sets of n1 and n2 are given. You can choose any one and see its effect on a plane polarised light.
   3. The value of specific rotation in radian/ cm is also provided. One can study the changes in that with different choices of n1 and n2.
   4. On clicking ¡°Next¡± you will be lead to step 2.
   5. In Step2 one can study "Change in Optical Rotation Due to Change in Wavelength".
   6. User can select any wave length from the choices given and see how the wave is bevaving in the anisotropic medium.
   7. The value of Specific rotation in rad/cm is also given.


    **Study of absorptive effect:**
   1. In the first step you can observe "Change in Ellipticity Due to Change in Difference of Extinction Coefficients". Here e1 means extinction coefficients of LCPL and e2 means extinction coefficients of RCPL.
   2. 5 sets of e1 and e2 are given. You can choose any one and see its effect on a plane polarised light.
   3. The value of ellipticity is also provided. One can study the changes in that with different choices of e1 and e2.
   4. On clicking ¡°Next¡± you will be lead to step 2.
   5. In Step2 one can study ¡°Change in Optical Rotation and Ellipticity Due to Change in Wavelength¡±.
   6. User can select any wave length from the choices given and see how the wave is behaving in the anisotropic medium.
   7. The value of Specific rotation and ellipticity is also given.
