The purpose of the lab is to understand the effect of chiral substance on a plane polarised light as a function of wave length.

By doing this experiment the user will be able to understand that:

(1) A plane polarised light is made up of one Right Circularly and one Left Circularly polarised light.

(2) Different Refractive Indexes for different circularly polarised components of an anisotropic medium give rise to Optical Rotation.

(3) Different rate of absorption for different circularly polarised components of an anisotropic medium gives rise to Circular Dichroism.

(4) Optical Rotation depends on the wave length of incident light and results Optical Rotatory Dispersion.
